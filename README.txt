15112 Term Project 
___________________________________________________________________________
Game name: QuackQuest
This project involves the game user controlling a mother duck navigating through a maze in the darkness with limited visibility to find her baby ducks. As time passes, more of the maze becomes visible until the entire maze is revealed, signalling the end of the game. If it is daytime and you havenâ€™t collected all the baby ducks, you will lose the game. Moreover, the mother duck can break through the walls (limited though), so it is your chance to find the shortest path to finish the task before the time ends. There are two game modes, generated respectively by DFS and Prim's. The second mode is relatively harder because there are more dead ends. There are also 2 player versions within each mode. Have fun saving the ducks!
