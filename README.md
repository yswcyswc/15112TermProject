Welcome to QuackQuest, an exciting game where you take on the role of a mother duck who has to navigate through a maze in the dark to find her baby ducks. As you progress through the game, more of the maze becomes visible, but you must find all the baby ducks before the sun rises. If you fail to do so, you will lose the game. 

To make things more challenging, the mother duck can break through some walls, but only a limited number of times. So, you need to plan your moves carefully to find the shortest path to finish the task before time runs out. 

QuackQuest offers two game modes, generated by Depth First Search and Prim's algorithms. The second mode is relatively harder because there are more dead ends, making it more challenging to find the baby ducks. Each mode also has a 2-player version, so you can play with a friend to collaboratively collect the baby ducks. 

Have fun saving the ducks!
